## Languages

Currently **English** and **Polish** (`--pl`) are supported in both game and solver.


## Requirements

- Python v3.8 and up
- Dictionaries located in `/usr/share/dict`
    - Ubuntu: `apt-get install wamerican` and others


## Bugs and todo:

- More dictionaries
- Support for other platforms (different dictionary format and location)
- Missing `--help` and `usage`
